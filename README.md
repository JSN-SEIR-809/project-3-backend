### MVP Goals
- As a user, I want to be able to add a todo and have that data persist.
- As a user, I want to be able to update a todo and have that data persist.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a todo and have that data persist.

## Stretch Goals
- As a user, I want to log into my account and only see my todos.

## Unsolved Problems
> We did not get to our stretch goal for the back end. We did create a schema, a database, and a controller for authentication though. In the future, we will be able to work on this stretch goal with the components already in place.
